# Art-Gallery-Visitor-Management-System

## Overview
The Art Gallery Visitor Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to manage visitor interactions within an art gallery. It utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Swing and AWT to provide a user-friendly experience for both standard and elite visitors.

##Aim
To efficiently manage visitor information, track visit history, handle purchases, reward points, and enhance membership privileges in an art gallery setting.

## Objectives
- Implement a structured system using OOP for better code organization and reusability.
- Ensure scalability for future GUI integration.
- Design intuitive wireframes and GUI layouts.
- Track visitor activities including purchases, cancellations, and upgrades.
- Provide interactive features like bill generation, file saving, and advisor assignment.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Swing and AWT (for GUI)
- OOP Concepts: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism
- File Handling: .txt and .dat formats
- Exception Handling: try-catch blocks for robust error managemmt

## System Features
- Visitor Registration: Add new visitors with validation checks.
- Login & Visit Logging: Track visit counts and active status.
- Product Purchase: Buy artworks with automatic discount and reward point calculation.
- Cancellation: Cancel purchases with refund logic and account termination after 3 cancellations.
- Discount Upgrade: Standard visitors get upgraded discounts after 5 visits.
- Personal Art Advisor: Elite visitors with >5000 reward points get assigned an advisor.
- Bill Generation: Generate and save detailed bills in .txt format.
- File Operations: Save and read visitor data from external files.
- GUI Panels: Multiple panels for registration, acquisition, and visitor records.

## GUI Highlights
- Register Guest Panel
- Art Acquisition Panel
- Visitor Details Display
- Interactive buttons

## Testing
The system has been thoroughly tested for:
- Validations (empty fields, invalid inputs)
- Functional buttons (Add visitor, Log visit, Buy products, Cancel products, Clear fields, Assign personal Art Advisor, Calculate Discount, Calculate Reward Points, Generate bill)
- File operations (Save to file and Read from file)
- GUI responsiveness and layout switching

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical application of Java OOP Concept
- GUI design using Switch and AWT
- Exception handling and debugging
- File I/O Operations
- System testing and validations

## How to Run
1. Compile the GUI Class:
        javac ArtGalleryGUI.java
2. Run the application
         java ArtGalleryGUI
